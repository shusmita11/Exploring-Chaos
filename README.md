# Exploring-Chaos
Exploring Chaos: A computer graphics project using OpenGL and GLUT. The project is a simulation and visualization of 4 remarkable attractors.

A fascinating area of physics and mathematics called 'Chaos Theory analyses the complex and unexpected behavior of dynamic systems. Four well-known attractor types - Chen-Lee Attractor, Halvorsen Attractor, Lorenz Attractor & Bouali Attractor are the specific focuses of this project's simulation.
 
This project implements advanced 2D transformations and rotation techniques to achieve a high level of realism in attractor rendering. Also, the keyboard functionality has been used for switching the attractors. pressing C will switch to the Chen-Lee Attractor, pressing H will switch to the Halvorsen Attractor, pressing L will switch to the Lorenz Attractor, and pressing B will switch to the Bouali Attractor.

This project was the outcome of excellent collaboration. Cheers to my teammates Umme Sumaiya Rashid Dristi, MD. Jahidul Islam Mirza Aysha Rahman Urme.For the Computer Graphics course that our university offers, we developed this project.
